# What the Hack: IaC DSC Challenge Solutions

If you are a hackathon host or proctor, the files in this folder contain the solutions for the DSC Challenges!

If you are a hackathon participant, this is the answer guide.  Don't cheat yourself by looking at these during the hack!  Go learn something. :)

## Note

When this hackathon was first delivered, the DSC Challenges were numbered 4 through 6 because they were designed to follow the ARM challenges 1 through 3.  We decided to renumber these DSC challenges as 1 through 3 in the Student Guide.  However, you will find the corresponding solution files here still numbered challenges 4 through 6.  This is honestly because we're too busy to update them.
