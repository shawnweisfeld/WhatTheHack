# Challenge 2 - Run the app

## Prerequisities

1. [Challenge 1 - Setup](./Setup.md) should be done successfuly.

## Introduction

With this second challenge you will be able to run "locally" in your Azure Cloud Shell the given "Rock Paper Scissors Boom" app.

![Run the app](../docs/RunTheApp.png)

## Challenges

1. Leveraging Docker, build and run the app from within Azure Cloud Shell. You can use the docker-compose.yaml file we have provided in /WhatTheHack/005-RockPaperScissorsBoom/Student/Resources/Code. 
     * See **Tips** below for an example of how to do this.
1. Test the app as an end-user, and play a game. You can reach the app via the dockerhost's public IP address. Try `az vm show` to find the IP address of your VM. Or, look for it in the portal.

## Success criteria

1. In Azure Cloud Shell, make sure `docker images` is showing you 5 Docker images.
1. In Azure Cloud Shell, make sure `docker ps` is showing you 2 Docker containers.
1. In your web browser, navigate to the app and play a game, make sure it's working without any error.
1. In Azure Cloud Shell, read the `docker-compose.yaml` file and the `Dockerfile*` files. What do you see? What do you understand? Are you able to quote 3 benefits/advantages of using Docker?
1. In Azure DevOps (Boards), from the Boards view, you could now drag and drop this user story associated to this Challenge to the `Resolved` or `Closed` column, congrats! ;)

## Tips

1. .NET Core is not installed in Azure Cloud Shell?! Don't worry, there's a Docker image for that!
     * You could for example run this command `docker-compose up --build -d` from the folder where the `docker-compose.yaml` file is.
1. To edit or read files from within Azure Cloud Shell, you could run `code .` to graphically browse the current folder and its files and subfolders. FYI, `cat` or `vi` are other alternatives.

## Advanced challenges

Too comfortable? Eager to do more? Try this:

1. Instead of leveraging Docker via Azure Cloud Shell, you could configure your local machine with Visual Studio Code, or Visual Studio, installed .NET Core and deploy your app locally.
